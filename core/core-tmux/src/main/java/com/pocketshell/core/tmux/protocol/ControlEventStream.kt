/**
 * Wraps a `Flow<ByteArray>` of raw `tmux -CC` lines (each one with the
 * trailing `\n` already stripped) into a structured `Flow<ControlEvent>`.
 *
 * The line type is `ByteArray` (issue #435): tmux emits raw high UTF-8 bytes
 * inside `%output` data under a UTF-8 locale and can split a multi-byte
 * character across consecutive `%output` events, so the bytes must reach
 * [ControlModeParser] without an intervening String round-trip that would
 * corrupt orphaned bytes into `U+FFFD`. Response-block payload lines (the
 * bodies between `%begin` and `%end`) are ASCII / UTF-8 text and are decoded
 * to `String` for [onResponsePayload].
 *
 * Responsibilities beyond what [ControlModeParser] already does:
 *
 * 1. Track the `%begin` / `%end` / `%error` response-block framing. Lines
 *    that arrive *inside* a block are the command's response payload — they
 *    are NOT events and must not be emitted as such. They're collected and
 *    delivered to [onResponsePayload] (defaults to a no-op) so the eventual
 *    SSH-side command-issuer in issue #44 can correlate request → response
 *    by call-number.
 * 2. Convert parser nulls (unknown opcode, malformed line) into a silent
 *    skip so the consumer's `collect` never has to filter manually.
 *
 * The class is intentionally not coroutine-scoped — it doesn't launch
 * anything. The caller owns the upstream `Flow<String>` and decides where
 * the flow runs (e.g. `flowOn(Dispatchers.IO)` once we wire it to sshj
 * in #44).
 *
 * @param parser the line parser. Constructor-injected so tests can supply a
 *   fake or a stub if they want — defaults to a fresh real parser.
 * @param onResponsePayload called once per payload line that arrives inside
 *   a `%begin` / (`%end`|`%error`) block, with the command-number from the
 *   opening `%begin` and the raw payload string. Defaults to a no-op.
 *   Issue #44 will wire this to the command-issuer's response correlation.
