/**
 * One event emitted by tmux running in control mode (`tmux -CC`).
 *
 * tmux's control-mode protocol is line-oriented: every notification or
 * command-response delimiter starts with `%` and is terminated by `\n`. See
 * `man tmux` (the CONTROL MODE section) and `control-notify.c` in the tmux
 * sources for the authoritative list.
 *
 * Per [D5](../../../../../../../../../docs/decisions.md) we consume this
 * protocol directly rather than screen-scraping a regular tmux PTY — the
 * structured events are what make per-pane rendering and tmux-native UX
 * possible at all.
 *
 * The set of variants below covers everything PocketShell needs in Phase 2.
 * Unknown / future event types fall through as null from
 * [ControlModeParser.parse] (rather than as a catch-all `Unknown` variant)
 * because the consumer ([ControlEventStream]) filters nulls anyway and we
 * want a compile error if we ever forget to handle a variant we said we'd
 * care about.
 *
 * Field naming convention: tmux session IDs are `$N`, window IDs are `@N`,
 * and pane IDs are `%N`. We preserve the prefixes in the string fields so
 * callers can pass them straight back to tmux in `send-keys`, `kill-window`,
 * etc. without rebuilding the syntax.
