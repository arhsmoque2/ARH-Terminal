/**
 * High-level client wrapping a `tmux -CC` control channel running inside an
 * [SshSession].
 *
 * The `tmux -CC` protocol is line-oriented: tmux speaks structured
 * notifications (`%session-changed`, `%output`, `%window-add`, …) and
 * command-response blocks (`%begin` / `%end` / `%error`) over the same
 * stdio pair as the host shell. This client owns the stdio plumbing —
 * spawn a tmux session over an open SSH shell, parse the stream of
 * notifications into a [Flow]<[ControlEvent]>, and let callers issue
 * commands with matching response correlation.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val client = factory.create(session)
 * client.connect()
 *
 * // Observe all non-output events:
 * scope.launch { client.events.collect { evt -> /* render */ } }
 *
 * // Observe a specific pane's output:
 * scope.launch { client.outputFor("%0").collect { bytes -> /* paint */ } }
 *
 * // Issue a command, wait for the matching response:
 * val r = client.sendCommand("list-sessions")
 *
 * client.close()
 * ```
 *
 * Concrete instances ship via [TmuxClientFactory]; this interface is the
 * boundary downstream modules (`app`, `core-terminal`'s tmux adapter)
 * program against.

     * The default implementation sends `refresh-client` (a no-op idempotent

     * NETWORK-TRANSITION call site (a WiFi↔cellular restore / handoff). On a
     * transition the recent reader bytes crossed the OLD socket's 4-tuple, so they
     * do NOT prove the NEW default network's path is alive — the #927
     * reader-activity fallback would let a silently-dead post-handoff socket pass as
     * "alive" (the maintainer's cellular spurious drop, where a fresh keepalive
     * timestamp masked a dead socket until the reader threw ~157ms later). When
     * `true`, the probe requires an actual ANSWERED round-trip over the (possibly
     * new) path and ignores the reader-activity fallback, so a dead cellular socket
     * is detected UP-FRONT before the restore arm rides through onto it. The
     * steady-state periodic drop probe keeps the default `false` (the #927

     * `-CC` connection disappears immediately. Without this step, a hard

     * plain `tmux attach` from a laptop) attached to the same session.
     *
     * Workflow:
     *  1. Issue `detach-client` over the live control channel via
     *     [sendCommand]. Bounded by [timeoutMs] / 2 so a slow / broken
     *     server cannot wedge the teardown indefinitely.
     *  2. Wait for the server to close the control channel — observed
     *     via [disconnected] flipping `true` from the reader-loop EOF
     *     path. Bounded by the remaining [timeoutMs] budget.
     *  3. Call [close] unconditionally. Step (3) runs whether the
     *     command + wait succeeded or not — losing the SSH transport
     *     mid-detach (network drop, sshd kill, etc.) must still result
     *     in a fully cleaned-up local state.
     *
     * Suspends until the detach round-trip completes or [timeoutMs]
     * elapses. Safe to call concurrently with [sendCommand] — the
     * underlying `sendMutex` serialises us with other inflight commands.
     *
     * Idempotent: calling on an already-closed or never-connected client
     * is a no-op (it still invokes [close] to be defensive).
     *
     * @param timeoutMs total ceiling on time spent on the detach
     *   round-trip + reader-loop EOF wait. Defaults to 1000ms, which is
     *   well above the sub-50ms tmux takes on a healthy localhost /

         * [readerActivityNanos] advancing, so the idle deadline re-arms on every
         * tick and NEVER fires even when THIS command's own reply is stuck
         * behind the redraw backlog and will never land (the attach `capture-pane`
         * seed on a streaming agent pane — the infinite "Attaching…" of #886, and
         * the #470/#835 enumeration stall). The idle gate alone therefore cannot
         * bound a command on a busy channel.
         *
         * [absoluteCeilingMs] adds a SECOND, independent watchdog that fires after
         * a fixed wall-clock window measured from the command's own dispatch,
         * regardless of reader activity. It is deliberately generous and DISTINCT
         * from the (much shorter) idle [timeoutMs]: a healthy command answers in
         * milliseconds, a busy-but-alive backlog answers within the ceiling, and
         * only a genuinely-wedged command (reply never lands while the channel
         * stays busy) reaches the ceiling and is cancelled. This preserves the
         * #576/#794 "busy link tears down a healthy session" protection — the
         * ceiling is far longer than any legitimate redraw — while guaranteeing a
         * command can never wait forever. Whichever watchdog (idle OR ceiling)
         * trips first cancels the body and returns `null`.

/**
 * Real implementation of [TmuxClient] backed by an [SshSession]'s shell
 * channel.
 *
 * Construction is cheap — [connect] does the actual SSH shell open and
 * reader-coroutine launch. Exposed via [TmuxClientFactory] so callers
 * don't need to know about the [SshShell] / coroutine wiring.
 *
 * @param session the SSH transport. Caller-owned: closing the client
 *   tears down the *shell* channel but leaves the session usable for
 *   further exec / port-forward calls (parity with `core-ssh`'s
 *   [SshSession.startShell]).
 * @param scope coroutine scope to launch the stdout reader on. A
 *   `SupervisorJob`-based child scope is created internally so the
 *   reader's failures don't cancel siblings of [scope]. The caller's
 *   scope's lifetime is the upper bound on this client's lifetime.
 * @param sessionName tmux session name to attach to (or create). Defaults
 *   to `"pocketshell"`. Blank input also falls back to this default. We
 *   use `new-session -A -s <name>` so existing sessions with the same
 *   name are reattached rather than refused.
 * @param startDirectory optional tmux `-c` start directory for newly
 *   created sessions. Existing sessions are still attached via `-A`.
 * @param commandTimeoutMs ceiling for a single control-mode command
 *   transaction, including stdin write/flush and response wait. A
 *   structural command timeout closes the client so callers see a
 *   disconnect instead of waiting forever behind a stalled SSH/tmux
 *   channel. Best-effort commands, fail-open rendering/resize commands,
 *   and completed `send-keys` writes get a short late-response drain
 *   window first so local output pressure does not masquerade as a
 *   transport disconnect. Command writes that fail or never complete
 *   remain fatal.
