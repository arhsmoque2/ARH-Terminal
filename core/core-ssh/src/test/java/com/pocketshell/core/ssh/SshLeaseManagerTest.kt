    // EPIC #792 Slice C / #822 WEDGE — the poisoned-warm-lease reuse mechanism.
    //
    // The #822 wedge: on a silent HALF-OPEN drop sshj's `isConnected` LIES — it
    // keeps reporting `true` until the ~60s keep-alive trips. The pool's `acquire`
    // reuses any entry whose `session.isConnected` is true, so a poisoned (dead-but-
    // lying) idle entry is REUSED and every auto-reconnect attempt re-dials the SAME
    // dead socket — the maintainer's "stuck Reconnecting, only the switch dance
    // recovers" wedge. The Slice C production fix makes the auto-reconnect ladder use
    // the force-fresh-lease path (`shouldForceFreshLease(AutoReconnect)` →
    // `acquireLeaseForTmux` evicts the idle lease via `evictIdle` before re-dialling),
    // which EVICTS the poisoned entry so the re-dial gets a FRESH transport.
    //
    // These two tests pin BOTH sides of that mechanism deterministically (no
    // toxiproxy, no emulator): the wedge (reuse) and its fix (evict-then-fresh). A
    // [FakeSshSession] that LIES about `isConnected` (the `connected=true` flag stays
    // set after the worker conceptually died) reproduces the half-open condition the
    // emulator cannot deterministically inject without the Slice D LivenessProbe.

    // many independent subsystems (session gateway, file explorer, git history,
    // folder list, conversation detection execs, recurring jobs, host list…)
    // each `acquire()` the SAME warm host, ONE connection emitted a STORM of
    // `Connected` events (the maintainer's ~9-up/1-down, 46/7 at scale) → a
    // storm of spurious `transport.up` edges → the #794 flap / re-projection
    // churn. A reuse of a still-up transport is NOT a transport-up edge.
    //
    // FIX: `stateEvents` is now a true transport-state EDGE stream — `Connected`
    // is emitted only when the key transitions INTO a live transport from a
    // not-live published state (`{null, Connecting, Closed}`), never on a reuse
