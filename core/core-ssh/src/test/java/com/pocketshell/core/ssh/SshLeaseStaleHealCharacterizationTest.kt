/**
 * EPIC #687 Phase-1 GATE — stale-channel heal at the SSH lease/transport layer
 * (the lease-side half of the #665/#680/#621 heal).
 *
 * The app-layer matchers `isStaleChannelSymptom` / `isSessionNotConnected`
 * (in `FolderListGateway` / `TmuxSessionViewModel`) classify a transient
 * stale-channel fault and then drive an EVICT-AND-RETRY-ONCE recovery: evict the
 * poisoned warm lease so the next acquire dials a FRESH transport, instead of
 * surfacing a false "not connected" banner over a host that is actually
 * connectable. Those matchers live in `app/` (owned by sibling issues), but the
 * lease-layer primitives they depend on live HERE in core-ssh:
 *
 *  - a pooled transport can silently drop (sshj's `isConnected` lies until the
 *    keepalive trips), and the lease pool reports it as no-longer-live so the
 *    heal knows to evict;
 *  - `evictIdle(key)` closes the poisoned zero-ref warm lease and makes the NEXT
 *    acquire dial a fresh transport — the evict-and-retry-once mechanism;
 *  - `evictIdle` leaves an ACTIVELY-held lease alone (the heal never yanks a
 *    transport out from under a live foreground holder);
 *  - a stale/disconnected pooled entry is auto-replaced on the next acquire even
 *    WITHOUT an explicit evict (the natural heal path).
 *
 * These PIN the CURRENT behavior and MUST stay green on current code.
 *
 * Learning map: #665 / #680 (stale-channel heal, false "not connected"), #621 /
 * #553 (stale SSH reattach reseed — lease eviction is the transport-side half).
