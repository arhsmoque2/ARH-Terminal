/**
 * EPIC #687 Phase-1 GATE — connect-coalescing characterization (the #620
 * learning at the SSH lease/transport layer).
 *
 * These tests PIN the CURRENT behavior of [SshLeaseManager]'s in-flight connect
 * coalescing so the Phase-2 hard-cut rewrite can be proven equivalent, not a
 * regression gamble. They MUST stay green on the current code. Where
 * [SshLeaseManagerTest] already covers a fact (happy-path coalesce,
 * `hasLiveOrConnectingLease`, the awaiter fallback), this file deliberately
 * pins the under-covered corners the EPIC brief calls out:
 *
 *  - the FIRST acquirer registers the in-flight `Deferred` under the mutex so a
 *    concurrent acquirer JOINS it (no second handshake);
 *  - owner FAILURE completes the slot and wakes awaiters;
 *  - owner CANCELLATION completes the slot and wakes awaiters (the
 *    `NonCancellable` `finally` cleanup at `runOwnedConnect`) — without this an
 *    awaiter would block forever on a deferred that never completes;
 *  - a fresh acquire AFTER an in-flight connect drains opens its own connect
 *    (the slot is cleared, not leaked).
 *
 * Learning map: #620 (connect coalescing / warm-lease first-open).
