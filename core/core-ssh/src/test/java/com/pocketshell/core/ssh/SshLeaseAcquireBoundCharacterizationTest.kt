/**
 * EPIC #687 (lease-acquire bounding slice) — pins the bound that stops a
 * wedged/slow SSH handshake from pinning [SshLeaseManager.acquire] forever.
 *
 * This is the SECOND picker wedge (#702 / #470): the picker's cold-open path
 * dials through `acquire`, and the sshj handshake bottoms out in a blocking JDK
 * socket read that is NOT a kotlinx suspension point. `withTimeout` at the
 * caller cancels the coroutine but cannot interrupt the in-flight blocking
 * read, so the acquire — and the picker — hangs in `Loading` with no
 * `PsFolderProbe` and even the downstream reconcile timeout never fires.
 *
 * The fix: the lease bounds the OWNED connect itself (`connectTimeoutMillis`),
 * running it as a manager-owned job it can cancel; cancelling that job propagates into
 * `SshConnection.connect`'s `invokeOnCancellation`, which disconnects the
 * half-open transport and unparks the blocking read. On expiry the acquire
 * surfaces a bounded [SshLeaseConnectTimeoutException] instead of hanging.
