/**
 * Issue #151 + #239 — `RealSshSession.close()` must be idempotent and
 * silent.
 *
 * The v0.2.7 crash report showed:
 *
 * ```
 * TransportException: [BY_APPLICATION] Disconnected
 *   at net.schmizz.sshj.transport.TransportImpl.disconnect(TransportImpl.java:397)
 *   at com.pocketshell.core.ssh.RealSshSession.close(RealSshSession.kt:179)
 *   at com.pocketshell.app.tmux.TmuxSessionViewModel.closeCurrentConnection(TmuxSessionViewModel.kt:1082)
 *   at com.pocketshell.app.tmux.TmuxSessionViewModel.connect(TmuxSessionViewModel.kt:243)
 * ```
 *
 * v0.2.8 then captured twin crashes on the same `onCleared` cascade
 * (issue #239 crashes A + B). The original narrow catch only handled
 * `BY_APPLICATION`; the wider contract now is that **any**
 * `TransportException` raised during teardown is non-actionable and
 * must not propagate. The Android lifecycle (activity destroy ->
 * `ViewModelStore.clear` -> `onCleared` on every ViewModel) is the
 * canonical close path under D21; teardown-time transport faults give
 * the caller nothing useful to recover from.
 *
 * Genuine "transport blew up while connected" diagnostics still surface
 * through the regular read/write path (sshj raises the same exception
 * on the producer-coroutine boundary), so widening this catch does not
 * hide a live-connection fault.
 *
 * This test pins:
 *   1. The `BY_APPLICATION` case is silently swallowed (idempotency).
 *   2. Other `TransportException` reasons are also swallowed (close is
 *      idempotent for every teardown-time transport fault).
 *   3. Repeated `close()` is a no-op.
 *   4. `IOException` / `ConnectionException` / `SocketException` from
 *      sshj's `disconnect()` chain are also swallowed.
 *   5. Close-while-disconnected (sshj already cancelled, then close
 *      arrives) propagates no exception.
