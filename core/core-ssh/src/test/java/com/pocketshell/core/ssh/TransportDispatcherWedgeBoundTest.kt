/**
 * Reproduce-first (issue #937 / D33 / G10) for the transport-freeze root
 * (#935 S4-1): WITHOUT a per-op ceiling, ONE wedged sshj write holds the
 * dispatcher's mutex forever, so every other write on the connection freezes
 * and the single dispatch thread is parked unreclaimably.
 *
 * Each test injects a synthetic wedged op (a body that blocks on a latch — the
 * half-open-socket-write stand-in) and asserts the SECOND op still makes
 * progress and the wedged thread is reclaimed. On the UNFIXED dispatcher these
 * hang (the second op never returns, the thread is parked) — the whole suite
 * SIGTERMs. With the per-op timeout + `runInterruptible` they pass.
 *
 * Every launched wedge job is JOINED before the test returns and its latch is
 * counted down first, so no daemon dispatch thread is left parked to throw an
 * uncaught exception into a sibling test's fork.
 *
 * Pure JVM, Docker-free — runs in the per-push Unit gate via `./gradlew test`.

     * outer close budget expires while disconnect is still wedged, closeNow()
     * must still interrupt/shutdown the worker even though the dispatcher is
     * already marked closed. That is the #937 symptom: without it the wedged
     * disconnect's worker thread is never interrupted, the half-open transport's
     * dispatch thread leaks, and the NEXT teardown wedges behind it.
     *
     * ## Why this test is shaped the way it is (issue #2109)
     *
     * The previous version of this test proved nothing about `closeNow()`. It
     * ran `closing.await()` BEFORE calling `closeNow()` — but
     * `closeAndAwaitDrain` runs the disconnect inside `runInterruptible`, whose
     * `withContext` cannot resume until the block RETURNS, and the block only
     * returns on a SECOND interrupt. So `closing.await()` could not return until
     * something delivered interrupt #2, and with `closeNow()` not yet called the
     * only remaining source was the per-op wall-clock watchdog at
     * `perOpTimeoutMs = 30_000`. The signature was in the CI data: that one test
     * measured **30.01s**, exactly its ceiling. `fun closeNow() {}` (empty body)
     * left it green.
     *
     * Two changes make `closeNow()` the load-bearing cause here:
     *
     * 1. The per-op ceiling is pinned [WATCHDOG_MUST_NOT_FIRE_MS] out — orders of
     *    magnitude past this test's own budget — so the watchdog CANNOT stand in
     *    for the call. Nothing observed within seconds can have come from it.
     * 2. `closeNow()` is invoked while `closing` is still IN FLIGHT (after
     *    interrupt #1, which the caller-side `withTimeout` cancellation
     *    delivers), and the second interrupt is asserted to arrive only after
     *    that call — with an explicit negative check first that it had NOT
     *    already arrived.
