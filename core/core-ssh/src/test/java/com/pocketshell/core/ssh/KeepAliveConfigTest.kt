/**
 * Docker-free guard for the issue #847 / #766-slice-1 keep-alive REMOVAL — the
 * always-runnable JVM backstop for "no background transport writer".
 *
 * Issue #548 had switched the provider to `KeepAliveProvider.KEEP_ALIVE` so a
 * `sshj-KeepAliveRunner` thread sent `keepalive@openssh.com` every 15s. That
 * background thread is a SECOND writer on the live transport; its periodic
 * global-request could land in a KEX/rekey window and desync the encoder
 * sequence counter, so the server logged `ssh_dispatch_run_fatal: ...
 * Connection corrupted` ~one keepalive interval after the handshake (the real
 * cause of the v0.4.10/v0.4.11 "loading tree" connect hang). The
 * single-transport-writer rule ([TransportDispatcher]) cannot tolerate an
 * un-ownable background writer, so the keepalive is removed (D22 hard-cut).
 *
 * These tests do not open a socket — they only inspect how [SshConnection]
 * configures the sshj client, which is exactly where the corrupting writer was
 * wired in. They INVERT the old #548 assertions: a freshly built client must
 * NOT be enabling a keepalive writer.

    // first test above already pins to 0 on the same `createClient()`. So no
    // build-time mutation could redden it alone (arming the interval inside
    // `createClient()` reddens test 1 while it stayed green), and the mutation
    // that DOES bring the #847 corrupting writer back — `KeepAliveProvider.KEEP_ALIVE`
    // plus arming the interval inside `RealSshConnector.connect()` — left ALL of
    // this class green because nothing here ever connects. That case is covered
    // where it belongs, against a real transport, by
    // `SshIntegrationTest.noKeepAliveBackgroundWriterThreadAfterConnect` (verified
    // RED under exactly that mutation). The deleted test also scanned
    // `Thread.getAllStackTraces()` JVM-wide, so a sibling class's thread in a
    // shared Gradle fork could false-positive it.
