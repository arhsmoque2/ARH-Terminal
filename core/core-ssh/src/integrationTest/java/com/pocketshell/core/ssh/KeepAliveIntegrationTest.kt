/**
 * Issue #945 — the SAFE dispatcher-serialized SSH transport keepalive (the real
 * "stays up like Terminus" fix) END-TO-END against a real Docker OpenSSH server.
 *
 * The maintainer's #1 dogfood pain: "I'm tired of reconnects and glitches and I
 * have to use Terminus." Terminus survives flaky Wi-Fi because it runs an
 * always-on, transport-level `ServerAliveInterval` keepalive. PocketShell had
 * NONE (removed in #847 because sshj's `KeepAliveRunner` was an un-ownable second
 * writer that corrupted KEX). [TransportDispatcher] is now the sole FIFO writer,
 * so a keepalive sent THROUGH it ([SshSession.sendKeepAlive]) is safe.
 *
 * Reproduce-first (D33/G10) — these run on the REAL [RealSshSession] /
 * [TransportKeepAlive] path against a real sshd, with a controllable in-JVM TCP
 * relay ([PausableTcpRelay]) in front of it so we can inject a REAL link gap on
 * the REAL encrypted transport:
 *
 *  - **Ride-through:** pause the relay for a window SHORTER than the keepalive
 *    budget (no FIN — a half-open starve), then resume. The transport keepalive
 *    rides through it: the session stays connected and a keepalive answers again
 *    after recovery. RED without a keepalive (nothing keeps the link warm / the
 *    detector has nothing to reset); GREEN with it.
 *  - **Dead-peer detection:** CUT the relay permanently. The keepalive misses
 *    answer, the loop declares dead within `countMax × interval`, and the dead
 *    transport is closed (the existing reconnect entrypoint) — no #822 regression.
 *  - **No KEX corruption (the #847 guard):** hold a real session > 100s with the
 *    keepalive cadence ON under concurrent traffic + rekey and assert the sshd
 *    log NEVER shows `Connection corrupted` / `Bad packet length` /
 *    `ssh_dispatch_run_fatal` — proving the keepalive-through-the-dispatcher does
 *    NOT reintroduce the #847 corruption.
 *
 * Wired into the per-push required check `Integration tests (Docker)` via the
 * `:shared:core-ssh:integrationTest` task (it includes all `*IntegrationTest`).

        // REAL OpenSSH testcontainer a SINGLE reply delayed past the 5s budget then
        // delivered does NOT permanently desync sshj's FIFO `globalReqPromises`. The
        // wire is strictly ordered, so the late reply R1 is polled by ITS OWN promise

 *
 *  - [pause]: stop forwarding bytes in BOTH directions (a half-open starve —
 *    the sockets stay established, no FIN) — the transient-gap case.
 *  - [resume]: forward bytes again.
 *  - [cut]: close all live tunnels and refuse new accepts (a hard dead peer) —
 *    the genuinely-dead-peer case.
 *  - [holdReplyDirectionOnce]: hold ONLY the server→client (REPLY) direction for
 *    a bounded window ONCE, while client→server (REQUESTS) keep flowing normally,
 *    then resume — the #985 single-slow-reply case. The request still reaches the
 *    server (so sshj keeps enqueuing reply promises into its FIFO) but the reply
 *    is delayed past the keepalive's local reply budget, which on base orphans the
 *    promise and desyncs the FIFO.
