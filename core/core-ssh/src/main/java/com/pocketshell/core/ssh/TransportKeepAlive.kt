/**
 * Issue #945 — the SAFE, dispatcher-serialized SSH transport keepalive (the
 * real "stays up like Terminus" fix).
 *
 * ## Why this exists (and why it is NOT sshj's keepalive)
 *
 * Terminus / OpenSSH survive a flaky Wi-Fi link because they run an always-on,
 * transport-level `ServerAliveInterval` ping over the encrypted channel: idle
 * gaps are absorbed, a real dead peer is detected on a conservative budget, and
 * — crucially — it is a SINGLE packet writer with no app contention. PocketShell
 * had NO such signal: #847 removed sshj's `KeepAliveProvider` because that
 * provider runs an **un-ownable `sshj-KeepAliveRunner` background thread** — a
 * SECOND writer on the live transport that could write `keepalive@openssh.com`
 * straight into a KEX/rekey window and desync the encoder sequence counter, so
 * the server logged `ssh_dispatch_run_fatal: ... Connection corrupted` ~one
 * keepalive interval after the handshake. The single-transport-writer rule
 * ([TransportDispatcher]) cannot tolerate an un-ownable background writer.
 *
 * The structural cause of #847 is exactly what [TransportDispatcher] eliminates:
 * every transport-touching op funnels through it and runs strictly one-at-a-time
 * in submission order, and no op is dispatched once teardown is enqueued. A
 * keepalive sent THROUGH the dispatcher ([SshSession.sendKeepAlive]) is just
 * another FIFO-serialized op — it cannot overlap a channel open, cannot
 * interleave a `-CC` write, cannot race a rekey/`die()`. So we own the keepalive
 * ourselves, serialized through the dispatcher; we do **NOT** re-enable sshj's
 * `KeepAliveRunner` (that would reopen #847 — [KeepAliveConfigTest] keeps that
 * door shut).
 *
 * ## Belt-and-suspenders with the #927 LivenessProbe
 *
 * This keepalive is the cheap, always-running, uncontended transport signal: it
 * keeps the encrypted channel warm and detects a transport-dead peer on a
 * ~90s budget (interval × countMax). The app-level
 * `com.pocketshell.core.connection.LivenessProbe` stays as the half-open
 * detector for the specific tmux-control-channel-wedged case the transport
 * keepalive cannot see. Together they close the Terminus gap; neither alone does.
 *
 * ## Determinism (the test seam)
 *
 * The loop's cadence is driven entirely by [delay] on the [CoroutineScope]'s
 * dispatcher, so a `TestScope` virtual clock advances the keepalive window with
 * zero wall-clock waiting (the same shape as [com.pocketshell.core.connection.LivenessProbe]).
 * The [intervalMs], [countMax], and the [KeepAliveIo] adapter are all injected so a
 * connected/Docker proof can shorten the window and flip a synthetic
 * dead/transient-gap state WITHOUT weakening any assertion or self-skipping.
 *
 * No `android.*`, no real IO inside this class: the actual ping + the dead-peer
 * reaction are the [KeepAliveIo] adapter. This stays a pure, deterministically
 * testable loop.

     *
     * ## Issue #928 (T1a) — true-cadence anchoring (no tick-grid aliasing)
     *
     * The pre-#928 loop slept a FULL [intervalMs] from every tick, including a
     * tick that SKIPPED its ping because real activity landed mid-sleep. A
     * server byte arriving just after a tick was therefore next protected by a
     * keep-warm ping only ~2×interval later, and a peer dying right after it was
     * declared dead only at ~(countMax+1)×interval — so any carrier NAT whose
     * idle window sits in the (interval, 2×interval) band reaped the idle
     * mapping BETWEEN pings (the per-host idle flap: the busy host's own traffic
     * keeps its mapping warm, the idle host's does not). Two corrections:
     *
     *  1. the skip path anchors the NEXT wake at `activity + intervalMs` (sleeps
     *     only the remainder), so an idle-going link is pinged within one
     *     interval of its LAST real activity regardless of tick phase; and
     *  2. the loop's OWN reply is excluded from the skip decision
     *     ([lastOwnKeepAliveReplyActivityNanos]), so a fully idle link holds the
     *     true `ServerAliveInterval`-style cadence — the ping's reply can never
     *     suppress the next scheduled ping.
     *
     * The busy-link intent is unchanged: REAL inbound/outbound within the last
     * interval still skips the ping (OpenSSH reset-on-server-traffic), and the
     * #1059/#1072 late-reply/upload ride-through still keys off the watermark
     * advancing across a miss streak.
     *
     * ## Issue #1059 (R2) — idle high-RTT / bufferbloat false-positive bound
     *
     * Reset-on-inbound only credits inbound seen within the LAST interval. On an
     * idle `-CC` link with bufferbloat pushing the keepalive round-trip past the
     * 5s per-reply budget, the per-tick send reports a "miss" each tick even though
     * the reply DOES land (late) — so the raw `countMax` consecutive-miss count
     * could declare a live link dead and redial it. The death decision therefore
     * does NOT fire on the miss count alone: before declaring dead it confirms that
     * the inbound-activity watermark did NOT advance across the whole streak
     * ([missStreakStartActivityNanos]). A half-open DEAD peer produces zero inbound
     * and can never advance it, so a genuinely silent peer is STILL declared dead
     * within `countMax × interval` (~90s) — the #945 contract is preserved exactly,
     * while a slow-but-answering link rides through.
     *
     * ## Issue #1543 / #1517 — virtual-clock test contract (must-run-forever loop)
     *
     * This is an intentionally INFINITE loop: in production it runs for the whole
     * life of the transport, and its ONLY terminal conditions are job cancellation
     * ([stop] / [scope] cancel) and [KeepAliveIo.isAlive] going false. It therefore
     * has NO idle-tick bound — one would weaken the on-device keepalive (it must
     * keep pinging an idle link forever), so an idle bound is deliberately absent
     * here (unlike the app render-heal watchdog, which re-arms on `%output` and can
     * self-terminate). The consequence for TESTS: a `TestScope` that STARTs this
     * loop and then calls `advanceUntilIdle()` will HANG FOREVER — the loop always
     * has a next scheduled `delay`, so the scheduler is never idle. This is the
     * exact #1517 (35-min CI hang) / #882 signature that #843 audit finding L1
     * flagged. Drive this loop from tests with a BOUNDED `advanceTimeBy(...)` +
     * `runCurrent()` and an explicit [stop] / `scope.cancel()` in teardown (see
     * `TransportKeepAliveIdleCadenceTest` / `NatIdleMappingSurvivalKeepAliveTest`),
     * NEVER `advanceUntilIdle()`. The parallel app-level [com.pocketshell.core.
     * connection.LivenessProbe] auto-start now defaults OFF in the unit-test
     * runtime for the same reason.
