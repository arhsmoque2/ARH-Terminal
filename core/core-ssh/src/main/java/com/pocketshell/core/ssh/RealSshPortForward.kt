/**
 * sshj-backed implementation of [SshPortForward].
 *
 * Equivalent to `ssh -L <localPort>:<remoteHost>:<remotePort>`. We do not use
 * sshj's bundled [net.schmizz.sshj.connection.channel.direct.LocalPortForwarder]
 * because it copies bytes through internal `StreamCopier` instances we can't
 * instrument for the per-tunnel byte counters required by [SshPortForward].
 * Instead we accept connections on our own [ServerSocket] and open a
 * [DirectConnection] (direct-tcpip channel) per accepted client, copying bytes
 * in both directions through counting streams.
 *
 * ## Single-writer transport safety (issue #980)
 *
 * Each accepted local connection opens a `direct-tcpip` channel, and each
 * EOF/teardown closes it. Both are transport-mutating SSH packets that advance
 * the encoder sequence counter — they MUST NOT race the dispatcher-serialised
 * keepalive / `-CC` / exec writes on the same transport, or the #847
 * `Connection corrupted` desync resurfaces. This class therefore never holds the
 * raw [net.schmizz.sshj.SSHClient]: it opens and closes every channel through a
 * [PortForwardChannelTransport], which funnels the channel-lifecycle packets
 * through the connection's single-writer [TransportDispatcher]. The local-socket
 * `accept()` and the byte copy loops stay off-dispatcher (they touch only the
 * local socket and the already-decrypted channel streams); only the SSH-side
 * open/close packets serialise.
 *
 * Internal to `core-ssh` — callers obtain instances via
 * [SshSession.openLocalPortForward].
