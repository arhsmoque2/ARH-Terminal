     * Issue #985 + #983 — await the keepalive reply without ever orphaning the sshj
     * promise and without holding the transport dispatcher mutex.
     *
     * sshj's `Promise.tryRetrieve(timeout)` returns `null` on timeout but does NOT
     * remove the promise from sshj's FIFO `globalReqPromises` queue (sshj exposes no
     * per-promise cancel). So a single reply slower than a BOUNDED `tryRetrieve`
     * budget would abandon a promise at the queue HEAD, every subsequent reply would
     * be delivered to the wrong (already-abandoned) promise, and every keepalive
     * thereafter would be a structural miss → `onKeepAliveDead` tears a live
     * transport. That is the #985 self-corruption that never self-heals.
     *
     * The fix: launch an UNBOUNDED `promise.retrieve()` on a throwaway coroutine on
     * the session [scope]. Because the wait is unbounded, the promise is ALWAYS
     * eventually polled by sshj's reader thread when its reply lands (even at t+30s)
     * — or woken with an error on `notifyError` (transport death) / cancelled when
     * the session [scope] is cancelled in [close]. So the queue slot is never
     * abandoned and the FIFO can never desync. A late reply always polls its OWN
     * promise.
     *
     * Liveness here is derived from [lastInboundActivityNanos] advancing (the reply,
     * via [recordInboundActivity] below, OR any reader byte), NOT from the bounded
     * wait — so the wait can be unbounded while the MISS decision stays bounded.
     *
     * Miss accounting (the correctness requirement): if the local
     * [KEEPALIVE_REPLY_TIMEOUT_MS] no-activity budget elapses with no inbound
     * activity, this returns `false` (a miss) REGARDLESS of whether the
     * `retrieve()` job is still pending. On a genuinely dead peer the job blocks
     * forever, so treating "pending" as "not a miss" would silently break dead-peer
     * detection and the 90s teardown would never fire. The single-flight guard
     * ([pendingKeepAliveReply]) suppresses duplicate wire requests/retrieves,
     * never the miss.

     * size is verified, and ONLY on a fully-successful transfer is the temp file
     * renamed (`mv`) onto [remotePath]. Any mid-stream drop / timeout / short
     * read therefore leaves the REAL attachment path untouched, never a 0-byte
     * or partial corrupt artifact at the destination.
     *
     * The previous design ran `cat > <final-path>` directly, which truncated the
     * destination to 0 bytes the instant the channel opened — so a disconnect
     * mid-transfer left a 0-byte file at the real path (the #928 D7 device
     * forensics: 9 zero-byte attachment files). That non-atomic path is gone.
     *
     * Why not SCP or SFTP? Both require an extra binary on the remote
     * (`scp` from `openssh-client`, `sftp-server` from
     * `openssh-sftp-server`). The Alpine-based Docker fixtures used
     * by the connected emulator tests ship the SSH server alone, and
     * minimal real-world servers often do too. The exec-channel +
     * `cat` approach only needs a POSIX shell, `cat`, `wc`, `mv` and `rm`,
     * which are universally present.
     *
     * Bounding (issue #930, folds in #928 D5 W-4): each blocking byte-copy step
     * and the final `join()` run under a real wall-clock no-progress ceiling, so
     * a wedged channel fails fast without imposing a whole-upload duration cap on
     * slow but progressing transfers.
     *
     * [length] is the declared content length. When known (>= 0) it is also
     * verified against the bytes the remote actually received before the rename,
     * so a truncated source (declares more than it emits) is rejected rather
     * than renamed as a short/corrupt file.

        // catch below hid the crash from the maintainer device but the
        // policy violation still aborted the disconnect mid-write,
        // leaving the sshj transport in a half-closed state and producing
        // logcat noise on every teardown.
        //
        // Issue #1135 / #1139 (D33 / G1 / G2 — HARD-CUT D22): the teardown is

        // (an `SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT` socket write that blocks up to
        // SESSION_CLOSE_TIMEOUT_MS on a wedged / half-open transport) is launched
        // on the object-owned IO [closeScope] and close() returns immediately.
        // The PREVIOUS body wrapped it in `runBlocking(Dispatchers.IO) { … }`,
        // which kept the socket WRITE off Main (StrictMode-safe, #166) but still
        // PARKED the CALLING thread for up to 2s. On the grace-loop

 * transport leaves the blocking JDK read parked forever; this is the boundary
 * bound that turns "the action silently never returns" into a fast, clear,
 * RETRYABLE [SshExecTimeoutException]. Issue #1567 (D28): on expiry ONLY this
 * exec's own channel is closed — the shared transport (and the live `-CC`
 * reader, concurrent execs, and in-flight uploads on it) stays ALIVE. A stalled
 * exec is not evidence of a dead link; the caller retries on the same warm
 * transport. Only a genuine transport-level death (keepalive/liveness) closes
 * the session.
 *
 * Issue #1046: this is now a per-read NO-PROGRESS window, NOT a whole-call
 * wall-clock ceiling. The budget RESETS on every byte that arrives on either
 * stream, so a slow-but-progressing exec on a high-RTT cellular link keeps the
 * shared lease transport alive for as long as it keeps making progress; only a
 * genuinely wedged read (no bytes on any stream for the whole window) is
 * bounded. The old whole-call ceiling closed the shared `-CC` session whenever a
 * progressing control exec exceeded 30s in TOTAL — a mobile spurious-reconnect
 * cause. This mirrors the per-step no-progress shape the transfer path already
 * uses ([UPLOAD_STALL_TIMEOUT_MS] / [DOWNLOAD_STALL_TIMEOUT_MS]).
 *
 * 30s is a generous no-progress window relative to a normal control exec (tens
 * of ms between bytes — env edit, profile list, start-dir autocomplete,
 * manual-kind write, watched-folder discovery, the file-viewer
 * `mkdir`/`pwd`/`cat`) yet bounds a truly wedged transport. It sits ABOVE the
 * three bespoke per-caller wraps
 * ([com.pocketshell.app.projects.SshFolderListGateway]'s `EXEC_READ_TIMEOUT_MS`
 * = 3.5s, `TreeRemoteSource`, `AgentKindRemoteSource`) so those tighter,
 * latency-sensitive enumeration bounds still fire FIRST on their hot paths and
 * this boundary bound is the safety net for every other caller that has no wrap
 * of its own.
