/**
 * Single-writer dispatch owner for ONE live sshj transport (issue #847 / #766
 * slice 1).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The maintainer's real host logged `ssh_dispatch_run_fatal: ... Connection
 * corrupted` ~60-76s after a successful handshake on every PocketShell
 * connection, while plain OpenSSH held the same host 90s+ clean. The research
 * spike on #847 traced it to a **client-side encoder sequence-number / cipher
 * desync**: PocketShell opens/writes the SAME warm transport from MANY
 * concurrent owners — the `-CC` control shell, a constant churn of short-lived
 * `exec` channels (tree hydrate, agent-kind, folder enumeration, jobs/profiles/
 * file-viewer), the liveness probe's `refresh-client`, the PTY `resizePty`
 * window-change, and teardown — with no single owner arbitrating channel
 * lifecycle vs. a KEX/rekey boundary vs. `die()`.
 *
 * sshj's `TransportImpl.write` already takes a process-wide `writeLock` so raw
 * bytes can never interleave mid-packet. The fault is one layer up: a channel
 * open or write that lands in the rekey window (cipher + sequence counters
 * rotating) or against a transport entering `die()` advances the encoder
 * sequence counter inconsistently with what reaches the wire, so the server
 * MAC-verify fails. Constant concurrent channel churn maximises that window.
 *
 * The durable fix (D28 single active path, D22 hard-cut) is a **single owner of
 * the connection's channel + command lifecycle**: every transport-touching
 * operation funnels through this dispatcher and runs strictly one-at-a-time, in
 * submission order, on a single dedicated thread. That removes concurrent
 * channel-open churn against the `-CC` shell and guarantees no write is
 * dispatched once teardown is enqueued (the dispatcher drains-then-dies in
 * order), closing the KEX/`die()` race window.
 *
 * The `-CC` continuous READ is deliberately NOT routed through here — it stays a
 * separate reader loop on the shell's stdout, exactly mirroring sshj's own
 * Reader-thread / writeLock split. This dispatcher owns WRITES + channel
 * LIFECYCLE only.
 *
 * ## Invariants (pinned by [TransportDispatcherTest])
 *
 * 1. **Mutual exclusion.** No two submitted operations ever run concurrently.
 *    Each [run] holds [mutex] for the whole operation, and acquisition is FIFO,
 *    so a channel open can never overlap another op's write.
 * 2. **Single thread.** Every operation body runs on [context], one dedicated
 *    thread, so even non-suspending sshj calls (`startSession`, blocking stdin
 *    `write`/`flush`) cannot run on two threads at once.
 * 3. **Teardown ordering.** Once [closeAndAwaitDrain] is called the dispatcher
 *    is [closed]; any operation submitted after that point is rejected with
 *    [TransportClosedException] BEFORE it touches the transport. Operations
 *    already enqueued/in-flight finish first (the teardown takes the mutex
 *    behind them), so the final `disconnect()` is the last write on the wire.
 * 4. **Bounded, interruptible per-op (issue #937 / S4-1).** Every operation runs
 *    under a hard [perOpTimeoutMs] ceiling, and its body runs inside
 *    [runInterruptible] so the ceiling can interrupt a wedged blocking sshj
 *    write/close and reclaim the dispatch thread. Without this a single sshj
 *    write that lands on a half-open link holds [mutex] FOREVER, freezing every
 *    other write on the connection and parking the single dispatch thread
 *    unreclaimably (the #935 S4-1 "always freezing / can't escape" root). With
 *    it, a wedged op fails THAT op with [TransportOpTimeoutException] (or
 *    surfaces a [TransportClosedException] once teardown has run) WITHOUT
 *    freezing the connection or leaking the thread.
 *
 *    The ceiling is driven by a REAL wall-clock watchdog ([WallClockCeiling]),
 *    NOT by coroutine `withTimeout` (issue #940). `withTimeout` reads the delay source
 *    from the CALLER's coroutine context — under `runTest`'s virtual,
 *    auto-advancing test clock that fires the ceiling INSTANTLY in virtual time
 *    while the real sshj op is still legitimately in progress on the executor
 *    thread, interrupting every healthy connect/exec/open and aborting it as a
 *    `ConnectionException`/`InterruptedException` or a spurious
 *    `TransportOpTimeoutException`. That broke the combined #927+#930+#937
 *    integration suite (13/21 red). A wall-clock watchdog interrupts the worker
 *    thread only after [perOpTimeoutMs] of REAL elapsed time, identically in
 *    production and under any test scheduler, so a healthy op is never aborted
 *    and a genuinely-wedged op is still reclaimed.
